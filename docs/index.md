## Welcome to FairyGui-Phaser Demo Pages

You can learn from this project how to generate a ui file in the FairyGui editor, import it into the Phaser project, and generate the corresponding ui

### First Step

Firstly, pre-load the corresponding ui binary file generated by the FairyGui editor. The large combined image can be loaded or not loaded. The logic of post-loading has been done internally, and it is recommended to load later.
Pass Scene to FairyGUi root node GRoot, and pass it into the corresponding root container

### Second Step

Create the corresponding UI object, because the load of Phaser is a queue, so the process of ui creation is asynchronous, so Promise is used here

### Third Step

Create the ui object in the corresponding package，you can adjust the view position, zoom and other parameters in this step

### Forth Step

Run the project, you can see that the ui has been displayed in the scene

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/akeboshi1/fairygui-phaser-test/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
